## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze sentiments of tweets directed at major US airlines. Using various machine learning techniques, we classify tweets based on sentiment to assist airlines in understanding customer feedback and identifying areas for service improvement.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Twitter US Airline Sentiment** dataset. It contains tweets classified as:
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative

**Features** include the tweet text, airline name, sentiment confidence scores, and more.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Twitter-US-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis.git
    cd Twitter-US-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the Data**: Run the notebook or script for data cleaning and feature engineering.
2. **Train the Model**: Train a sentiment classification model with the provided scripts or notebooks.
3. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate model performance on test data and check metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**To run the Jupyter notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Twitter_US_Airline_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Model and Approach
This project employs natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Key steps include:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning methods).
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **X%** on test data. Key findings include:
- Distribution of positive, neutral, and negative tweets.
- Patterns in customer feedback based on airlines.

Results can help airlines identify trends and respond to customer feedback more effectively.
